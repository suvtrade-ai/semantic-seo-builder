Identifies and validates entities, builds attribute matrices (popular, prominent, relevant), maps entity relationships, and defines context vectors and topical boundaries. Produces 02-semantic-research.md.

# Semantic Research (Phase 2)

If `01-foundation.md` exists, read it first to understand the business context. Otherwise ask for: business type, services, city.

**If the site already has a GSC property connected via Composio:** before starting entity research, call `GOOGLE_SEARCH_CONSOLE_SEARCH_ANALYTICS_QUERY` with dimensions=["query"] for the past 3 months to pull real query data. Use these queries to:
- Identify which entities Google already associates this site with (queries containing entity names = validated by real user behavior)
- Find missing entity coverage gaps (competitor queries this site does not rank for — these are Phase 2 entity research targets)
- Detect any semantically out-of-scope queries the site ranks for (potential topical boundary violations — flag them)

Then perform the following and write to `02-semantic-research.md`:

## Entity Identification
Identify entities across these types: Business entity, Service entities, Location entities, Credential entities, Tool/material entities, Process entities, Person entities, Problem entities.

List all as a table: Entity | Type | Relevance | Source

## Entity Validation
For each entity, validate via:
- Source-based: Wikipedia, schema.org, Google Knowledge Panel
- SERP-based: Knowledge Panel presence, consistent competitor mentions, PAA coverage
- Contextual: does removing the entity make the content feel incomplete?

Mark each: Validated | Partially Validated | Excluded (reason)

## Attribute Matrix
Search top 20 pages for the primary query. Extract:
- Popular attributes: what most pages mention
- Prominent attributes: what TOP 3 pages emphasize heavily
- Relevant attributes: semantically adjacent but underused

Build table: Entity | Popular | Prominent | Relevant | Coverage Gap

## Entity Relationship Map
Map how entities relate: is-a, has-a, used-for, located-in, associated-with, part-of
Table: Entity A | Relationship | Entity B | Importance

## Context Vectors & Topical Boundary
List: In-scope topics (site should cover) vs. Out-of-scope topics (would dilute authority).
Write 5–10 context signal sentences describing the topical space.

Produce `02-semantic-research.md` and confirm it was saved.

## Integration: seo-cluster (Phase 2 → Phase 3 bridge)

After completing the entity and attribute matrices, pass the core entity list to `seo-cluster` to pre-validate your topical clusters against real Google SERP overlap before committing to the Phase 3 topical map:

```
/seo cluster plan [primary entity keyword]
```

Why here: SERP overlap analysis reveals which entity combinations Google treats as the same topic (7+ shared results = same page) vs. distinct topics (0-1 shared results = separate pages). This prevents building a topical map where you accidentally plan two pages that should be one.

**Output:** `cluster-plan.json` and `cluster-plan.md` — feed these into Phase 3 (`topical-map`) as the starting architecture. The topical map skill will refine it using Koray's hub-and-spoke methodology.

## Integration: seo-dataforseo (optional, if API connected)

If DataForSEO is connected, use it during entity validation to pull real keyword volume and competition data for the core entities:

```
/seo dataforseo keywords [entity name] [city]
```

This replaces the manual SERP volume estimation step with real data. Use the returned CPC and competition scores to prioritize which entity attributes to cover first (highest volume, lowest competition = fastest wins).

**If DataForSEO is NOT connected:** proceed with WebSearch-based SERP estimation. Flag this in `02-semantic-research.md` as "estimated volumes — upgrade with DataForSEO when available."

## CoR Step — EAV Triple Validation + Knowledge-Based Trust

After completing the Attribute Matrix, run an EAV validation pass on all discovered entities. Reference `cor/frameworks/eav-architecture.md` and `cor/audits/knowledge-graph-validation.md`.

### EAV Triple Validation Checklist

For every key fact in `02-semantic-research.md`, verify:

```
[ ] Explicit naming — entity is named directly, no ambiguous pronouns
[ ] Specific values — numbers and measurements, not "many" or "some"
[ ] Definitive modality — "is" for facts, "can" for possibilities, "should" for advice
[ ] Consistent units — same measurement system throughout
[ ] Source-backed — fact can be verified from Wikipedia, schema.org, or authoritative source
```

### Knowledge-Based Trust (KBT) Consistency Check

All EAV triples extracted here become the **locked source of truth** for the entire site. Add a KBT table to `02-semantic-research.md`:

```
| Entity | Attribute | Locked Value | Source |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [CE]   | Price range | [exact range] | [source] |
| [CE]   | Location | [exact address] | NAP |
| [CE]   | Turnaround time | [X days] | owner confirmed |
```

**KBT killers to flag and reject:**
- Vague values: "affordable", "quick", "high quality" → replace with specific numbers
- Contradictory values: if Page A says "2–3 days" and Page B says "3–5 days" → standardize now
- Missing citations: claims without a verifiable source → add source or remove

**Why this step matters:** Google's Knowledge-Based Trust patent scores sites on consistency of facts across pages. Contradictions increase Cost of Retrieval and reduce trust scores. See `cor/concepts/cost-of-retrieval.md` for the full breakdown.

Append the KBT table to `02-semantic-research.md` before Phase 3.
